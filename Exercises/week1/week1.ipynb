    "### Starting up\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open up Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows). \n",
    "2. Enter a directory that you'd like to have as your `Home`, e.g., where your cloned `HEC-NLP` Github repo resides. \n",
    "3. Type `jupyter notebook` and enter. After a few moments, a new browser window should open, listing the contents of your `Home` directory. \n",
    "    - Note that on your screen, you'll see something like `[I 17:23:47.479 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/`. This tells you where your notebook is located. So if you were to accidentally close the window, you can open it again while your server is running. For this example, navigating to `http://localhost:8888/` on your favorite web browser should open it up again. \n",
    "    - You may also specify a port number, e.g. `jupyter notebook --port 5656`. In this case, `http://localhost:5656/` is where your directory resides. \n",
    "4. Click on a notebook with `.ipynb` extension to open it. If you want to create a new notebook, in the top right corner, click on `New` and under `Notebooks`, click on `Python`.\n",
    "    - You can rename your notebook by clicking on its name (originally \"Untitled\") at the top of the notebook and modifying it. \n",
    "    - Files with `.ipynb` are formatted as a JSON and so if you open them in vim, emacs, or a code editor, it's much harder to read and edit. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Alternatively*, if you are *visual studio code* user, you can use the [Jupyter extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) to run notebooks directly in the editor without the above steps and needing to open a browser.\n",

If you hover over them, the tooltips explain what each one is for: saving, inserting a new cell, cut/copy/paste cells, moving cells up/down, running/stopping a cell, choosing cell types, etc. Under Edit, Insert, and Cell in the toolbar, there are more cell-related options. \n",

They are used for situations where you might want to convert your notebook to HTML or LaTeX using the `nbconvert` tool or File -> Download as a format that isn't `.ipynb`.
